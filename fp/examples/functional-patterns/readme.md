# Functional Patterns

Here are some examples of functional programming patterns. Each pattern contains an `.md` file with an in-depth explanation and additional resources.

* [Impure vs Pure functions](https://github.com/cmda-tt/course-21-22/blob/main/fp/examples/functional-patterns/impure.md)
* [Immutability](https://github.com/cmda-tt/course-21-22/blob/main/fp/examples/functional-patterns/immutability.md)
* [Higher-order functions](https://github.com/cmda-tt/course-21-22/blob/main/fp/examples/functional-patterns/ho-functions.md)
* [Composition](https://github.com/cmda-tt/course-21-22/blob/main/fp/examples/functional-patterns/composition.md)

## Programming paradigm
*Functional programming* is a [programming paradigm][paradigm]. A way to classify programming languages based on their features. JavaScript supports **multiple paradigms** but you'll probably use either imperative (object-oriented) or declarative (functional). Remember that functional programming are just a collection of  patterns and principles written with JavaScript.

## Output

In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on its arguments. This might sound a bit vague but in short, you don't want your code to have any **side-effects**. That is if something in your code modifies some state variable value(s) outside its local environment such as a function (scope).

```js
INPUT -> PROCESS -> OUTPUT
```

## Core principles

* Composing of functions. A function that operates on other functions, so limited side effects.
* No dependence on the state of the program. Such as global variables.
* The same input always gives the same output (purity).

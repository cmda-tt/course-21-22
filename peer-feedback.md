# Peer review exercise

## Goal
- Understand the rubric better
- Get feedback on your work
- Help a peer by giving feedback on their work

## Preparation
- Read the rubric. Is everything clear? (dynamic means the visualization would still work for different data in the same format)
- Push the latest changes to your readme, code, and wiki
- Pair up in groups of two

## Review
Take about 20 minutes to do this
- Scan someone else's repo
    + gitignore
    + link to live demo on github pages
    + description
    + concept
    + image
    + link to example used to build visualization
    + data used (what's done with invalid and empty values?)
    + (link to) functional pattern 
    + plagiarism and acknowledgements
- Read the wiki, can you follow the datacleaning and transforming process?
- Read the code
    + try to understand the code flow
    + Do you see any improvements?
    + Be sure to check code quality (is it functional, consistency, reusability, naming conventions etc.)
- Assess assignment according to rubric (If you cant assess something, write in an issue why)
- Write your feedback in issues on their repo (separate issue for each thing)
- Positive feedback is also welcome and can be put into an issue

## Closure
- Review the issues that were created for your own repo. Ask your peer about them if you don't understand.
- Respond to the issues with an action (for instance: valid point, will fix)
- Close relevant issues before the assessment by solving them.

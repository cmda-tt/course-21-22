      <td align="center"><strong>Views are rendered dynamically from data</strong>; interpreting the representation is easier that interpreting the raw data itself</td>

      <td align="center">The student can explain some parts of their code, how some parts works together, and some technical choices</td>
      <td align="center">Student understands how components, state, lifecycle works in their app. The project is structured logically. Merits of frameworks can be explained</td>
      <td align="center">The project is complex but can easily be understood; student used or wrote code not covered in class that was carefully chosen while weighing alternatives</td>

> **Note**: each of this rubricâ€™s rows is cumulative: for example, to get a 5-6
> on application, you also need to have a 1-2 and 3-4. In addition, each row has to be awarded with a >=5.5 in order to receive a passing grade for this course.
> Bonus points can be rewarded when you've helped fellow students progress. But only if you already have a passing grade.

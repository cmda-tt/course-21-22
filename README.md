## Description

During the Tech Track you‚Äôll learn how to create interactive visualizations from external data while using libraries and advancing your web dev skills. We focus on frontend frameworks, such as React and Vue, and data visualization with D3. This enables you to make your ideas for the web into reality. Though the subject matter is technical, attention to user experience and interaction design is, as always in our programme, stressed.

**Tech Track** is an elective track of three courses given in Information
Design (fall semester), building further on knowledge acquired in
**Internetstandaarden**, **Inleiding Programmeren**, **Frontend 1**, **Project-Tech**,
**Frontend 2**, and **Back-end**.

If you‚Äôd like to continue with web development after this track, pick the
[**Minor Everything Web**][minor] in the spring semester!

## Assignment

During the upcoming 6 weeks, you will build and develop a set of tools, functions and layouts, using libraries and native API's to investigate datasets, analyze their content, sanitize them, transform them into appropriate and normalized JSON files and finally apply them in a visualization using D3.

## Communication

## Goals

The main goals in this track are that you‚Äôre able to:

*  Clean, transform data with functional programming patterns
*  Create interactive visualizations from external data
*  Use D3 to create interactive visualizations
*  Work with front-end framework and think in components
*  Refactor, debug and read complex programs (code)
